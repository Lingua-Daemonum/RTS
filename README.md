# spl (Scripting Programming Language)
A high-level scripting language that operates in interpreter + just-in-time (JIT) mode and converts scripts directly into machine code.

Based on the Latin alphabet as a technical and any other language as explanatory-accompanying, more understandable to the developer.
> This is associated with the widespread use of the Latin alphabet in exact sciences and global distribution. In one English word, there can be many meanings, and the generalizing meaning is clearly visible. However, this does not exclude porting the syntax to other world languages. The original form of spl should be taken as an international standard.

Involves writing programs of any complexity and running them in interpretation mode.
> Why interpreter?
> 1. Makes the code executable in real time.
> 2. Allows you to run multiple programs.
> 3. The language is stored separately from the program itself.
> 4. No need to compile the program several times.
> 5. The interpreter can be configured before starting the program.

The code is read from top to bottom line by line and taking into account the level of nesting.
> spl considers indentation as creating a new block from lines of code. If such an attachment has been given a name, then a data structure of the type Class, Enum, List, Method and others will be formed.

>   1. Lines of code (commands) -(form)-> code blocks (structures).
>   2. Everything is converted to machine code -(transmit)-> CPU.

The emphasis is on logic programming, which is based on speed and performance, as well as the correct operation of the program.
> This involves developing efficient algorithms and data structures to ensure that the program runs quickly and efficiently. It also implies that the program must perform its functions correctly and be reliable.
