# spl (Scripting programming language)
A high-level scripting language that operates in just-in-time (JIT) mode and converts scripts directly into machine code.

The use of a non-structured programming approach is envisaged. The emphasis is on logic programming, which is based on speed and productivity, and the correct operation of the program. In turn, block programming is present to implement the program logic. It is supposed to use a system of named and temporary blocks, as well as goto, goup, goend operators. It is also proposed to omit if, while, for and similar structures in favor of using simpler structures and algorithms.
